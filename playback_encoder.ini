[RotaryEncoder]
; GPIO pin number connected to the SIA/DT pin of the encoder
; For most rotary encoders you can control direction of the rotation by swapping SIA/DT abd SIB/CLK pins.
SiaPinNumber=13 ;5

; GPIO pin number connected to the the SIB/CLK pin of the encoder
; For most rotary encoders you can control direction of the rotation by swapping SIB/CLK and SIA/DT pins.
SibPinNumber=19 ;6

; GPIO pin number connected to the the SW pin of the encoder
SwPinNumber=26 ;19

; Key stroke that will be simulated after detection of left rotation
